<h1>Website Mission</h1>

<p>When selecting a weightlifting program, it is important to have a goal before beginning. Often, this goal is either to train for hypertrophy (optimizing muscle growth), strength (optimizing lifting as much weight as possible), or a combination of both. This site is to help direct novice lifters to quality programs they can use which are tailored to their goals.</p>

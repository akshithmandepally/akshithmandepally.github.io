<h1>What supplements should I be taking?</h1>
<p>Supplements are an optional but extremely helpful addition to a weighlifting program. This page will share the ones I have used and have seen great results from.
Disclaimer: do your own research before using any of these products, a link to a credible source detailing the specifics of the mentioned supplements is included below!</p>
<h2>Supplements I recommend</h2>
	<h3>Caffeine</h3>
		Helped to increase the intensity of my workouts and made it easier to get to the gym on days I was tired
	<h3>Whey protein</h3>
		Made getting the necessary daily protein to sustain muscle sythesis much easier, especially as a college kid with limited time to cook
	<h3>Creatine</h3>
		Well studied, naturally occurring supplement which optimizies muscle energy production and made it easier to put on size and strength
